This repository documents the independent study conducted by Ivan Martinez-Arias, advised by Adam M. Smith, at UC Santa Cruz during Fall 2024. Through connecting the Gemini LLM with a web-based videogame emulator, we introduce the concept of live coaches. We describe how the LLM uses tools to read/write information from the emulator, allowing it to answer users' queries about ongoing play.
